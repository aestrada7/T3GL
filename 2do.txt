-Log Parser-

2:Badger3920> haha oh so like i post a log
2:Badger3920> and it searches for stats?
2:VanHelsing> That would rock and it'd help avoid retarded mistakes
2:Badger3920> yeah
2:VanHelsing> But right now it just *reads* the log. Thus meaning it shows the log as if you were watching the Continuum console :p
2:VanHelsing> It would only search AFTER <XTEAM> defeats <YTEAM> in <Z> minutes.

-Predictions-

It predicts. Gets winner. Gives 3 points if MATCHED score, BUT fails if loser score is 0. Why? No fucking idea.
It needs tracking which could be like this:

Standings:

VagueKatti - 7pts
Eagle+     - 4pts

Both would have a link to predictuser.php which would have something like:

Round 3
URMOMISEZ 0:18  Vantage. (Match Score)
d.n.      18:10 URMOMISEZ (Match Score)
d.n.      0:18  Vantage. (Match Winner)
somesquad 0:10  someother (TACHE ROJO)

Round 4
somesquad 5:0 someoneelse (Not played yet)
