<u><b>Redesign</u></b><br>

Well, this is the new design of the league website, hope you guys like it. There are also several new features around which mostly do with league staff to change, but there's one thing that I believe you guys will like, it's a prediction tracking similar to what we had in discopalace, you can only predict before the round starts, so all your predictions will have to be submitted by friday since all the rounds start on saturday. This website should be almost totally bug-free, however if you find anything, let me know as soon as possible, either via a ?message on Continuum, or drop me an e-mail to vanhelsing44@gmail.com. Enjoy!

<u><b>Stuff</u></b><br>

Yeah, I'm out of internet so if you haven't seen me around, that's why. Though I still read the forums at work... K, here's what I updated:<br /><br />
* You can kick players out of your roster (if you're a squad captain).<br />
* You can also leave the squad (fags).<br />
* On League Staff you won't see NH thrice anymore.<br />
* You won't see "Create a Squad" or "Join a Squad" if you already have a squad.<br />
* League Staff can now update scores.<br />
* And with that done, you can now check the standings.<br />
* And also check a single match score.<br /><br />
Anyway, coding without testing is like driving blind so expect more bugs. If you find one, let me know asap on the forums.<br /><br />
Also, avoid telling me the design is awful - I already know that.

Squad menu didn't show up correctly and had all the options available whereas that shouldn't happen since only the Squad Captain can authorize people and Promote Trustees (This will be up soon).
